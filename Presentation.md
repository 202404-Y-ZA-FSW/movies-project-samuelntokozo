# Presentation

- Come prepared for the presentation
- Have the website ready and deployed on Netlify or Vercel. Do not present from localhost!
- Have Github ready. Go over issues and PRs
- You will be devided to teams of 2, each member will participate in the presentation, 5 minutes for each member. Remember the requirement that every member must be able to to explain any part of the code. Please think about what you want to say beforehand, usually people make it up as they go and it takes too long. I will cut you off if it goes longer than a minute, for the sake of having everyone present.
- What were the three hardest problems that you faced?
- Reflection: How did you feel the difference was between working on madlibs and this project? (DOM manipulation VS React)
